# SKW

SKW is a comprehensive set of tools for building and managing the lifecycle of your own custom Linux distribution. It consists of three core components:

* **SKW Builder:** Automates the process of compiling your system from source code.
* **SKW Installer:** Manages the installation and deployment of your custom distribution.
* **SKW Manager:** Provides ongoing control and maintenance for your finished system.

Together, these tools—collectively known as the **Scratch Kit by wiigelec**—transform the complex and time-consuming process of Linux From Scratch (LFS) into a streamlined, end-to-end solution. LFS is a method for building a Linux system entirely from source code, a powerful educational process that gives you a deep understanding of your operating system. Our SKW tools simplify this journey, allowing you to focus on the design and customization of your perfect distro. It's the best of both worlds: a hand-built system with professional-grade tools for control and maintenance.
