# --- Build Execution Configuration ---
[build]
# The command to run after checkout. This example uses standard autoconf/make steps.
# The command sequence ensures the final artifact (e.g., a library) is moved 
# into the dedicated output directory.

# The final destination directory for build results. The GitBuilder module
# will ensure this path is created before the build command runs.

shell = true

# Working directory (optional). If omitted, defaults to the 'target_dir'.
