# Configuration Reference: book.toml

> The **`book.toml`** file is the primary configuration for defining a "Book" in the ScratchKit system. A Book represents a source of build instructions, typically a Git repository containing a structured document like the Linux From Scratch book. This file tells the `builder.py` script where to find the source repository and how to generate the final XML file that the parser needs.

## `[main]` section

All configuration keys are located under the `[main]` table.

### **`repo_path`**

* **Type**: `String`
* **Description**: The URL of the Git repository where the book's source files are located. The `install-book` command will clone this repository into the build directory.
* **Example**: `repo_path = "https://git.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs.git"`

### **`version`**

* **Type**: `String`
* **Description**: The specific version of the repository to use for the build. This can be a branch name, a tag, or a commit hash. The `install-book` command will run `git checkout` with this value.
* **Example**: `version = "12.3"`

### **`rev`**

* **Type**: `String`
* **Description**: Specifies the revision or edition of the book to generate, which is often used as a variable in the build command. For LFS, this is typically `systemd` or `sysv`. This value is passed as an environment variable to the `make_command`.
* **Example**: `rev = "systemd"`

### **`make_command`**

* **Type**: `String`
* **Description**: The shell command that needs to be executed from within the cloned repository to generate the final XML book file. The command can use the `${book_dir}` and `${rev}` variables, which will be substituted by the `install-book` process.
* **Example**: `make_command = "make RENDERTMP=${book_dir} REV=${rev} validate"`

### **`output_file`**

* **Type**: `String`
* **Description**: The name of the XML file that is generated by the `make_command`. This is the file that the `SKWParser` will use as its input.
* **Example**: `output_file = "lfs-full.xml"`
